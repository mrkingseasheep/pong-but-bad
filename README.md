# Obama Ball

Have you ever wanted to play pong? Generic enough question right? Well, have you ever wanted to play pong, but with Obama? Now there's a novel thought! Obamaball is a fun pong clone with exciting powerups, sound effects and a monkey.

## In all seriousness...

I'm using this to learn about SFML and opengl. Don't expect uhhh, well don't expect much of anything. Look back to pong, past its nostaglia and into the bottomless pit of hell. That's where your expectations should be on this one.

## How to use

`git clone` the repo.

Run `./app` if on linux.

### Or to build yourself...

`git clone` the repo

Install `sfml` following the [guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-linux.php)

`make` the project

## Future TODO list

- [ ] More powerups
- [ ] More sound effects
- [ ] Better visuals
